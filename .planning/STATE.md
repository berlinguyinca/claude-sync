## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 3-phase structure derived from 10 v1 requirements (coarse granularity). Foundation -> Sync Ops -> Cross-Platform.
- [Roadmap]: Research suggested 4 phases, but Phases 3-4 from research (auto-sync daemon, UX polish) map entirely to v2 requirements. v1 scope is 3 phases.
- [01-01]: Used real temp directories (fs.mkdtemp) for scanner tests instead of mocking fs
- [01-01]: Allowlist uses startsWith for directory targets (ending with /) and exact match for files
- [01-01]: Path rewriter uses simple string replaceAll -- no regex needed since home dir paths are literal
